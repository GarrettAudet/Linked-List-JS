Javascript Linked List

This project implements a basic Linked List in JavaScript, a fundamental data structure that offers dynamic data management. Unlike arrays, linked lists store elements in nodes that are linked through references, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions without the need for reallocation or restructuring the entire data structure.
